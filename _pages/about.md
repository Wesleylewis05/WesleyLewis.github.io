In May 2024 I graduated from the University of Virginia (UVA) School of Engineering and Applied Science with a B.S. in Computer Science.

Iâ€™m primarily interested in developing and integrating sensing techniques for robot manipulation and understanding of their environments. I worked in the Collaborative Robotics Lab at UVA led by Professor Tariq Iqbal, focusing on multi-agent reinforcement learning for human-robot collaboration. I've also worked at the Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction Lab led by Professor Zackory Erickson at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute. Currently I make regular contributions to the Radio Telemetry Tracker Project for Engineers for Exploration at the University of California San Diego.
