I’m a fourth-year undergraduate at the University of Virginia studying computer science.

I’m primarily interested in developing and integrating sensing techniques for robots to manipulate and understand their environments. I work in the Collaborative Robotics Lab at UVA led by Professor Tariq Iqbal, focusing on multi-agent reinforcement learning for human-robot collaboration. This summer, I will be at the Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction Lab led by Zackory Erickson at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute. I will continue my research using spectroscopy and tactile sensing for liquid classification and manipulation.
